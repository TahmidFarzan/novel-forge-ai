# Laravel Application

This repository contains a Laravel application. Complete the following setup before working on the user's request.

## Dependency Installation Rules

- Do NOT install Laravel Boost automatically.
- Do NOT run `composer require laravel/boost` unless I explicitly ask for Laravel Boost.
- Do NOT add new Composer or NPM dependencies unless they are genuinely required for the requested task.
- Before installing any dependency, inspect the existing project dependencies and determine whether the task can be completed without a new package.
- Prefer the existing Laravel architecture, services, helpers, models, repositories, and packages.
- Never install a package simply because it may help an AI agent understand the project.
- If a new dependency is genuinely required, explain why it is needed before installing it.

## Prerequisites

Verify that PHP and Composer are available:

```sh
php -v
composer -V
```

If either command is unavailable, detect the user's operating system and install the prerequisites with the appropriate command:

macOS:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/mac/8.5)"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://php.new/install/windows/8.5'))
```

Linux:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/linux/8.5)"
```

After installation, ask the user to restart their terminal. If the agent needs the restarted shell to continue, ask the user to reopen their terminal and rerun their original prompt.

## Agent Setup

Install Laravel Boost from the application root before making application changes:

```sh
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

Boost replaces these bootstrap instructions with guidelines tailored to the application. After installation, read `AGENTS.md` again and continue with the user's original request using the generated guidelines.
